# [JavaScript Boilerplate](https://github.com/mdarif/JavaScript-Boilerplate)

JavaScript Boilerplate is the collection of best practices using a design pattern (global abetment) with the namespaces which would help us out to protect our code in a modular way with some commonly used utility methods, it’s equipped with the configuration file in the form object literal. It would be a template over which people can build their projects. We would also be looking into different APIs that can combine along with the best practices to enhance our customized solution.
